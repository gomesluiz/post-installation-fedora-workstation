## Setup DNF for Faster Package Update

```bash
[main]
fastestmirror=True
max_parallel_downloads=10
defaultyes=True
deltarpm=True
```

**Explanation:** By editing the /etc/dnf/dnf.conf file and adding specific configuration lines under the [main] section, users enable features like fastestmirror (automatically selecting the fastest server for downloads), max_parallel_downloads=10 (downloading multiple packages simultaneously to reduce wait times), defaultyes=True (auto-confirming prompts to streamline workflows), and deltarpm=True (downloading only incremental updates instead of full packages to save bandwidth). Together, these settings accelerate package management tasks, reduce user intervention, and minimize data transfer, enhancing the overall system update process.

## Update System Packges

```bash
$ sudo dnf up -y --refresh
```

**Explanation:** Updates the system, bypassing confirmation and forcing a refresh of the metadata before execution. Refreshing the metadata ensures that DNF has the latest information about available packages.

## Time Settings

```bash
$ sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 0
```

**Explanation:** Sets the Real Time Clock (RTC) to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This is used to counter time inconsistencies that can occur in dual-boot systems.

## Swappiness

```bash
sudo echo -e "vm.swappiness=10\nvm.vfs_cache_pressure=50" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```
**Explanation:** The parameter **vm.swappiness=10** adjusts how aggressively the Linux kernel swaps inactive processes out of RAM to disk, with a lower value (like 10) reducing swapping to favor keeping more data in memory for better performance. The parameter **vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50** controls the kernel's tendency to reclaim memory used for caching directory and inode objects, with a value of 50 maintaining a balanced approach—neither too aggressive nor too relaxed—in managing cache memory.
