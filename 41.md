## Setup DNF for Faster Package Update

```bash
[main]
fastestmirror=True
max_parallel_downloads=10
defaultyes=True
deltarpm=True
```

**Explanation:** By editing the /etc/dnf/dnf.conf file and adding specific configuration lines under the [main] section, users enable features like fastestmirror (automatically selecting the fastest server for downloads), max_parallel_downloads=10 (downloading multiple packages simultaneously to reduce wait times), defaultyes=True (auto-confirming prompts to streamline workflows), and deltarpm=True (downloading only incremental updates instead of full packages to save bandwidth). Together, these settings accelerate package management tasks, reduce user intervention, and minimize data transfer, enhancing the overall system update process.

## System Update

```bash
$ sudo dnf update -y --refresh
```

**Explanation:** Updates the system, bypassing confirmation and forcing a refresh of the metadata before execution. Refreshing the metadata ensures that DNF has the latest information about available packages.

## Time Settings

```bash
$ sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 0
```

**Explanation:** Sets the Real Time Clock (RTC) to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This is used to counter time inconsistencies that can occur in dual-boot systems.
