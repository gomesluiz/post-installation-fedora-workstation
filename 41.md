# Fedora 41

## System Update

```bash
$ sudo dnf update -y --refresh
```

**Explanation:** Updates the system, bypassing confirmation and forcing a refresh of the metadata before execution. Refreshing the metadata ensures that DNF has the latest information about available packages.

## Time Settings

```bash
$ sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 0
```

**Explanation:** Sets the Real Time Clock (RTC) to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This is used to counter time inconsistencies that can occur in dual-boot systems.
